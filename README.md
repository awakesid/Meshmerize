# Meshmerize
A bot that can solve the maze. 

﻿# Introduction

Meshmerize is a bot that uses sensors to read the maze and find the shortest path. It is the best project to learn electronics and test your coding skills.


# RULE

You can make anything that can solve maze with a certain size limit and shouldn't be controlled by any wireless controller.**Refer IIT Bombay Meshmerize rule book**
